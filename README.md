# WatchDog
WatchDog is a rapid deploy WebApp to prevent theft of WiFi-enabled browser-capable mobile devices with a camera, like most modern laptops, tablets and phones. WatchDog uses geolocation, WebRTC to detect motion, Socket.io to determine loss-of-connection and the Twilio API for SMS alerts or phone call notifications. WatchDog will also bark to prevent theft!

## History
Born in the thick of Battle(Hack-NYC-2015), WatchDog was conceived when a professional thief evaded security cameras and stole a team-member's unattended laptop. Because another team-member knew of a friend who recently had her mobile phone stolen, that same week, and had already been thinking about how to prevent theft of WiFi-enabled browser-capable mobile devices.
## Awards
WatchDog was conceived, planned, implemented and demonstrated in less than 24 hours at BattleHack NYC 2015 where it was awarded the Twilio Sponsor Prize.
